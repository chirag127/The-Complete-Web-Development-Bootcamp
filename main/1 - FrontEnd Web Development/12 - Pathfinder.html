Zero Experience</strong></p><p>For complete beginners, I recommend starting from the very beginning and making sure you don't skip any of the lessons or modules. The tutorials and challenges build on each other, so taking the course is a bit like hiking a mountain. I know some of the later modules are really cool and there's a temptation to jump straight to it, but without the proper foundations, it's easy to get lost and demotivated. </p><p>Make sure that you are completely comfortable with the concepts in each module of the curriculum before moving on. Usually, for beginners, I recommend spending a week on each module.</p><p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/v4/t/lecture/12287318/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Start Here</a></p><p><strong>2. Some Experience</strong></p><p>Alright, you already have some experience, so let's try to keep it fresh and not waste time repeating stuff you already know. I recommend starting at the intermediate level tutorials and making sure you complete all the challenges. If you find the challenges too hard, then it might be worth going back to some of the earlier tutorials and reviewing the concepts. </p><p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/lecture/12287460#overview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Start Here</a></p><p><strong>3. Quite Experienced</strong></p><p>Ok, the programming concepts should be easier for you, especially if you already know quite a lot about Javascript. I recommend skipping the introductory programming modules and dipping into them only if needed. Instead, try to complete all of the lessons that have the word challenge in their title to reassure yourself you've understood the concepts and can safely skip them.</p><p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/v4/t/lecture/12383928" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Start Here</a></p><p><strong>4. Experienced Developer New to Web</strong></p><p>Alright, you're probably here to quickly get up to speed with web development. Most people in this camp will have some experience with HTML and CSS, so I recommend starting with the Javascript modules. As Javascript seems to live in its own land and has a number of weird features(/bugs), it might be a little shocking for people coming from safer languages (e.g. Swift).</p><p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/v4/t/lecture/12371320/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Start Here</a></p><p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Experienced Web Developer</strong></p><p>Ok, you know Javascript, HTML and CSS like the back of your hand, but every week you hear about a new JS framework and you've decided it's finally time to buckle down and figure out what these kids are talking about. We'll start with Node and move on to Express, EJS, Mongo and more to get you quickly up to speed (and hopefully ditch PHP).</p><p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/v4/t/lecture/12384268" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Start Here</a></p><p><strong>6. Want to Learn React</strong></p><p>Well, you seem to know what you want! That's great. I'll just show you the way to the 8-hour React module built for experienced developers:</p><p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/lecture/17038306#overview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Start Here</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: These are just my suggestions! You are a free agent and you know your own needs better than me. Feel free to browse through the curriculum and learn at your own pace!</p><p><br></p><p>All the best,</p><p>Your instructor, Angela</p>
