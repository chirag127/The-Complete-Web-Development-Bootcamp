*   Any proof-of-concept (POC) code or steps (if applicable).

### Vulnerability Response Process

1.  **Acknowledgment:** We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 24-48 hours.
2.  **Triage:** We will assess the severity and impact of the vulnerability.
3.  **Resolution:** We will work to fix the vulnerability as quickly as possible.  This may involve patching code, updating dependencies, or other measures.
4.  **Disclosure:** Once the vulnerability is fixed, we will publicly disclose it (if appropriate) and credit you for your report (if you wish).
