1.  **Clone the repository:** (See Step 2 above)
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:** `cd WebDev-Odyssey-Full-Stack-Bootcamp-Project-Showcase`
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    bash
    # Using npm
    npm install
    
    # Using yarn
    yarn install
    
    # Using pnpm
    pnpm install
    
4.  **Run the Application (Example for a typical full-stack setup):
    *   **Frontend:** Navigate to the frontend directory (e.g., `client` or `frontend`) and run its start script (e.g., `npm start` or `npm run dev`).
    *   **Backend:** Navigate to the backend directory (e.g., `server` or `api`) and run its start script (e.g., `node index.js` or `npm start`).
    *   **Database:** Ensure your database (e.g., MongoDB) is running and accessible.

*Note: Specific commands might vary depending on the individual project structure within the showcase. Refer to individual project READMEs if available.*
